# ASSESSMENT 3: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Tell me about a project or accomplishment youâ€™re proud of.

- Nugget:  My last several years in the military, I was placed in an HR department that lacked efficiency. 
- Situation: The HR department was very slow in proccessing soldiers' concerns. This caused many soldiers to be frustrated and ultimately dread going to HR for anything. 
- Task: I was tasked with resolving time sensitive personnel matters while simultaneously working to improve office functions.
- Action: In order to improved efficiency, I prioritized all incoming personnel in a manner that maintained confidentiality and increased communication across teams.
- Result: Simple issues were addressed within 48 hours while complex issues were addressed within 7 business days. By the time I left the army, there was an improved system of quicker resolutions for all involved parties.

2. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation in your job.

- Nugget: When I worked for the Atlanta Hawks as a Guest Experience Supervisor, I had to work between the arena security, NBA and arena officials, and also my own supervisors to resolve an altercation.
- Situation: Two families were seated in their assigned seats in a section of the arena that I was in charge of. Members of each family got into a verbal altercation and a guy ended up hitting a woman of the opposite family with his beer. 
- Task: I needed to find a way to relocate one of the families to another area, keep everything from escalating even more, and deal with the situation before Atlanta Police were called and arrests were made. The problem was that the basketball game was sold out and I needed special permission to open up reserved seating to accomodate the offended family. 
- Action: I started to coordinate communication between my own department, arena security, and arena officials to open up special seating just for that family.
- Result: The family was happy and gave great reviews. The offenders were removed from the arena and more than likely banned because of the nature of the disruption. Atlanta Police did not have to get involved.
